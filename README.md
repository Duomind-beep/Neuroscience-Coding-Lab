# Neuroscience-Coding-Lab 🧠💻
Welcome to Neuroscience-Coding-Lab, my personal space for experimenting with computational neuroscience concepts! This is where I explore neuron models, simulations, and other brain-inspired coding projects as I deepen my understanding of neuroscience and programming.

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

🔬 Simulations of basic neuron models (starting with the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neuron!)

🧩 Small experiments with Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, and more

📖 Notes, insights, and learning progress as I develop computational neuroscience skills

## 🛠️ Work in Progress

This lab is always evolving! I’m using it to practice, tinker, and refine my coding skills while applying them to neuroscience concepts. Expect frequent updates, experimental code, and maybe even some bugs! 🐛

## 💡 Why This Exists

I’m on a journey to merge my passion for neuroscience with computation. This repo isn’t about perfect code—it’s about learning, experimenting, and growing as I explore the intersection of brain science and programming.
