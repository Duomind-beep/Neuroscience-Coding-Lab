# Neuroscience Coding Lab 🧠💻

Welcome to **Neuroscience Coding Lab**, a personal space for experimenting with computational neuroscience concepts. 

## What’s Inside? 🚀


## Future Plans 🛠️

- Implement more neuron models and network simulations.

- Gradually build more code from scratch as I understand it better.

- Explore interactive visualizations for brain simulations.
