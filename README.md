# Neuroscience Coding Lab 🧠💻

Welcome to **Neuroscience Coding Lab**, a personal space for experimenting with computational neuroscience concepts. This repository is a collection of neuron models, simulations, and brain-inspired coding projects as I deepen my understanding of neuroscience and programming.

## What’s Inside? 🚀

- **Potassium Equilibrium Model**: A model simulating the potassium equilibrium potential and its impact on neuronal activity.
  
- **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neuron**: A basic model to understand how neurons integrate inputs and fire once a threshold is reached.

## Future Plans 🛠️

- Implement more neuron models and network simulations.

- Gradually build more code from scratch as I understand it better.

- Explore interactive visualizations for brain simulations.
