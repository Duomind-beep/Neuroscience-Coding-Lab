# Neuroscience Coding Lab 🧠💻

Welcome to **Neuroscience Coding Lab**, a personal space for experimenting with computational neuroscience concepts. This repository is a collection of neuron models, simulations, and brain-inspired coding projects as I deepen my understanding of neuroscience and programming.

## What’s Inside? 🚀

- **Potassium Equilibrium Model**: A model simulating the potassium equilibrium potential and its impact on neuronal activity.
  
- **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neuron**: A basic model to understand how neurons integrate inputs and fire once a threshold is reached.

- Small experiments using Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, and more.

- Notes, insights, and learning progress as I refine my computational neuroscience skills.

## Work in Progress 🛠️

This lab is always evolving! As I continue to learn, tinker, and experiment, I plan to:

- Implement more neuron models and network simulations.

- Gradually build more code from scratch as I understand it better.

- Explore interactive visualizations for brain simulations.

## Why This Exists 💡

I’m merging my passion for neuroscience with computational skills. This repository is about learning, experimenting, and growing as I explore the intersection of brain science and programming.
