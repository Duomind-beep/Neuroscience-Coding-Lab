# Neuroscience-Coding-Lab 🧠💻
Welcome to Neuroscience-Coding-Lab, my personal space for experimenting with computational neuroscience concepts! This is where I explore neuron models, simulations, and other brain-inspired coding projects as I deepen my understanding of neuroscience and programming.

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

🔬 Simulations of basic neuron models (starting with the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neuron!)

🧩 Small experiments with Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, and more

📖 Notes, insights, and learning progress as I develop computational neuroscience skills

## 🛠️ Work in Progress

This lab is always evolving! I’m using it to practice, tinker, and refine my coding skills while applying them to neuroscience concepts. Expect frequent updates, experimental code, and maybe even some bugs! 🐛

## 💡 Why This Exists

I’m on a journey to merge my passion for neuroscience with computation. This repo isn’t about perfect code—it’s about learning, experimenting, and growing as I explore the intersection of brain science and programming.


## 📌 Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neuron

The first project in this repository is a basic Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model. Since I am still in the early stages of my programming journey, this implementation is not built from scratch, but rather adapted from established resources and guided exercises. My goal was to understand how the model works, modify key parameters, and visualize its behavior using Python and Matplotlib.
While I followed structured guidance for the initial code, I am actively working toward deeper independence in coding, analysis, and eventually developing my own models.

## 🚀 Future Plans

As I advance in my studies, I plan to:

Implement more neuron models and network simulations

Gradually write more code from scratch as my understanding improves

Explore interactive visualizations for brain simulations
